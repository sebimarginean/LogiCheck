# LogiCheck

## About LogiCheck
LogiCheck is a Python script designed to evaluate the logical equivalence, tautology, and contradiction of logical expressions. Utilizing a straightforward Tkinter graphical user interface, LogiCheck enables users to effortlessly input logical expressions and ascertain their logical relationships and characteristics.

## Features
- **Logical Equivalence Checking:** Determine if two logical expressions are equivalent.
- **Tautology Verification:** Check whether a logical expression is universally true, independent of its variables' truth values.
- **Contradiction Determination:** Identify if a logical expression is universally false.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive GUI for entering expressions and obtaining results.

## How to Use LogiCheck
1. **Launch the Application:** Execute the script to open the LogiCheck user interface.
2. **Input Expressions:** In the provided fields, type the logical expressions you wish to evaluate. LogiCheck accepts basic logical operators like `&&` (and), `||` (or), `!` (not), `=>` (implication), and `<=>` (equivalence).
3. **Select the Operation:** Choose the operation to perform (verify equivalence, check tautology, or test contradiction) by clicking the corresponding button.
4. **View Results:** The application will display the results below the input fields, indicating the logical status of the expressions or the expression being analyzed.

## Supported Operators
- `&&`: Logical AND
- `||`: Logical OR
- `!`: Logical NOT
- `=>`: Implication
- `<=>`: Equivalence

## Requirements
LogiCheck is developed in Python and uses Tkinter for the graphical interface. Make sure Python and Tkinter are installed on your system to run the application.

## Installation
No special installation process is required. Simply download the LogiCheck script and run it in your Python environment.
